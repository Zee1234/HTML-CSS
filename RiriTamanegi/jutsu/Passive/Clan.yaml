    Tamanegi have an innate understanding of their mind and their memories coupled along with very good memory. Each Tamanegi is able to Mind Dive which is a higher state of meditation which can be triggered at any time and allows them to recollect their memories in the form of a first person perspective. While Mind Diving however their body is static and immobile leaving them open to attacks. At Apprentice Knight they can recall their short term memories up to 20 posts (total) previously and their long term memories from 10 topics previously perfectly. Each rank up adds +5 to both short term and long term causing a Platinum Knight Tamanegi to be able to recall their short term memories up to 40 posts (total) previously and their long term memories from 30 topics previously perfectly. When in Mind Dive the user goes through memories in a slowed state being able to fast forward, rewind and pause memories while viewing them to understand them better.
    Riri's current Short Term Memory Retention = 20 posts
    Riri's current Long Term Memory Retention = 10 topics

    Tamanegi are able to use elements, however their proficiency in elemental techniques are not as high as others causing them to suffer penalties to their element release using techniques. At Apprentice Knight no penalties are observed, at Bronze Knight rank they cost +1 to chakra cost, At Silver Knight Rank they cost +1 to chakra/blood cost and -1 to rank (Damage), At Gold Knight they cost +2 to chakra/blood cost and -1 to rank (Damage) and finally at Platinum Knight they cost +2 to chakra/blood cost and -2 to rank (Damage).

    Tamanegi have a secondary memory storage system within their brain which is able to catalog memories collected from others and is completely separate from the Tamanegi's own memory so as to not add extra stress to their brain. Depending on their age the total amount of memories they can catalog varies.

    Tamanegi are weavers of lies and fabricators of false events so it came as no surprise that they found themselves naturally juxtaposed with Dakar that use Fabrication techniques. The Tamanegi are able to shrug off Fabrication with Kai similar to how they do with genjutsu giving them a tactical advantage against the mental based technique with such few counters.
