Riri grew up as an only child. For the longest time, she wished she had a sister. Someone to take her father's attention. Someone to distract him. So that maybe Riri would get a peaceful day. This day never came, however. Riri tried confiding in her mother, but the women said everything was ok. Riri did not think it was ok. It did not feel ok.

Riri came home one day to find her mother no longer there. Riri's father never told her what happened. Her mother's disappearance did not stop Riri's torment.

Riri was scared. Confused.
Angry.
She wanted this to end. She needed it to end.
In one night, it ended. Riri does not remember that night. She does not want to. She woke up in her bed, bleeding. Her father lay next to her, sprawled out on the bed, completely unresponsive. Riri ran to the corner and curled up there, rocking on her heels. It was three days before someone found Riri. She was still curled up in the corner, passed out from dehydration. Her father was still sprawled out on the bed, completely unresponsive. This time, however, it had an obvious reason.

He was dead.
Riri was never quite right after that night, if she ever had been in the first place.
