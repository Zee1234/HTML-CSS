Riri stands at six feet four inches. [url=http://i.imgur.com/dbSdQ2s.jpg]Her hair[/url] is short, the longest strands being barely two inches in length. While not flat, the hair does not have heavy curls. This makes it a bit of a mess atop her head, with clumps of hair twisting every which direction. If left on its own, she would have constant bedhead. She does, however, put enough effort into her hair to style it. This makes the hair look less like a rats nest, and more like a carefully directed current, twirling around her head. Her hair is a [url=http://i.imgur.com/97mmLUr.png]pure white naturally. However, she dyes the majority of it a [url=http://i.imgur.com/TffYwza.png]solid black[/url]. Imagine the [url=http://i.imgur.com/G7jMJKX.jpg]Skrillex haircut[/url], except the bald side is left white while the rest is dyed.

[url=http://i.imgur.com/rgQgZgp.png]Riri's right eye is a bright amber color. Her left, however, is a menacing red.[/url] She has a [url=http://i.imgur.com/VIYiOzv.jpg]light olive skin tone[/url]. She does not tan much. The shape of her face is [url=http://i.imgur.com/GzLHRrR.jpg]rather androgynous[/url], lending itself to messing with people.

Riri is quite slender. With a rectangular body shape and b cups, even though she is quite tall, she still looks small (just not short!) Toothpick legs and stocky arms complete the appearance. Aside from the colors of her eyes and her hair, Riri's body is almost perfectly symmetrical, giving it an alluring beauty.
