Riri is... twisted. Most obvious is her sadism, which is readily apparent from the get go. She has a profound dislike of people except as a means to her ends. There are exceptions, but they are few and far between.

Riri likes the night. Not because she likes darkness or any such idea. If anything, she prefers the sun. No, the reason she likes the night is because fools multiply in the night. The drunk. The tired. The broken. These are the ones that stalk the night, and they are easy pickings.

Not that Riri does not like the occassional hard job. There is more thrill in harder prey. But sometimes they are resistant. They refuse to act hurt, even when the pain must be excrutiating. Those are the ones Riri has no care for. They are a waste of her time. A waste of her ability. They are fools who deserve nothing from her, let alone life.
